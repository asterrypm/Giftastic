Giftastic

GIPHY activity

 
Giftastic is a GIPHY activity that incorporates the use of the GIPHY API.

This website uses an array of Hawaii centered topics like Volcanoes and surfing.  There are a few buttons that are rendered upon load of the page and then there is a submit button to add additional topics of choice for the user.  If one of the buttons is clicked, then ten Gifs load with that content type along with the rating of that particular Gif.  The gifs load in an animated state and if the user clicks on the gif itself the animation will pause until the gif is clicked again.  The gif's and buttons clear when the page is refreshed.
